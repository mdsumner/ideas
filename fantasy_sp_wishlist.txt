o sp Lines and Points with more than two (X/Y) coordinates

o n-dimensional b-box

o extent/bbox with projection (why is this not obvious?, what am I missing)

o (I think we maybe got this around 2015) robust "transform if needed" in R

what happens here?  

project(project(x, proj, inv = TRUE), proj, inv = TRUE)

proj4string(x) <- CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")
spTransform(x, CRS("+proj=longlat +datum=NAD83"))

proj4string(x) <- CRS("+proj=laea")
spTransform(x, CRS("+proj=laea"))

This is a general problem also with round-tripping in GDAL etc. the "only WKT is enough" thing, discussed:

o on the fly reprojection for graphics

plot(x, add = TRUE) ## what if the plot is not in projection(x)? 

one package does register its projection against an existing graphics device (fields/mapproj?)

- perhaps this is done like this with a wrapper, like with() or animation::saveHTML

projectIfNeeded(global = transform_to, {
   plot(x)
   area(y)
   et.c
   })
