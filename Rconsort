A new package for the NetCDF library would be helpful. 

NetCDF files store *variables* (arrays), built on *dimensions* (axes used by the variables, with metadata), and *attributes* (variable metadata, and global metadata). 

Typically, you create a connection to a file, and use that connection to read in a variable (or a slice from one) after interrogating the conection for the variable's dimensions and attributes. Sometimes these are mapped grids with a simple 1D axis variable for each dimension - affine, or rectilinear referencing, others have "coordinate arrays" where the positioning is stored explicitly - curvilinear referencing. 

Currently there is good support in R for NetCDF via the ncdf4 and RNetCDF packages, and indirectly via the raster package (leveraging ncdf4) and rgdal (leveraging GDAL). I was very impressed with how much abstraction raster and GDAL provide, but it covers only a relatively small range of the possible file configurations. 

Apart from the domain-specific higher level functions in rgdal and raster for dealing with 2 or 3D grids with affine georeferencing, there is little abstraction over the standard API use. 

A modern i/o package for the format would allow domain-specific packages to be more easily written for specific sources.  This is possible now, but it's limited and quite challenging for many users.  It would be awesome 

1) to be able to have a virtual R array that just paged for data from the NetCDF as it was needed

2) to write a DBI front-end on top of a new modern wrapper to NetCDF. 

3) to have support for composite types, which are not provided by any R package at the moment

All of these would be more readily achievable with a new wrapper.
